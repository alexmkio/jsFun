### Study
- [ ] Classroom removeViolence
- [ ] wtf adding index to end of sort findHighestHumidity; also turned an array of objects into one object (no longer nestled inside [])
- [ ] pretty proud of national parks.getParkVisitList
- [ ] ugh findHighestAbvBeer .sort2, less {}
- [ ] in clubs I used reduce to avoid declaring a global variable (newObj = {}) as in the example using map above it

### Questions
- [ ] Can I do groceryList w/o a global var?
- [ ] why couldn't I get find to work in studentsForEachInstructor?
